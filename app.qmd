::: {.card title="USING THE DASHBOARD"}

This dashboard summarizes fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) data for a baywide assessment and for data collected as part of the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) monitoring program. The latter is specific to evaluating fecal impairments in the Hillsborough and Alafia river basins. The assessments are meant to inform progress remediating fecal impairments or to support prioritization of areas for further investigation. They are not meant to support beach monitoring efforts or closures for recreational uses - alternative reporting products are available for that purpose (see [FLDOH Healthy Beaches](https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/beach-water-quality/county-detail.html?County=Pinellas&Zip=33701-3109){target="_blank"} and [Pinellas County Recreational Water Quality Map](https://pinellas.wateratlas.usf.edu/maps/coastal-water-quality-map/){target="_blank"}). The dashboard is organized in the following sections:

1)  [**BAYWIDE**](#baywide): View baywide summaries of *Enterococcus* data at select monitoring locations for each bay segment
2)  [**HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY**](#hillsborough-county): View summaries of Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) FIB data for the Hillsborough and Alafia River basins
3)  [**MANATEE COUNTY**](#manatee-county): View summaries of Manatee County FIB data for select monitoring locations
4)  [**DATA DOWNLOADS**](#data-downloads): Download baywide, Hillsborough County, or Manatee County data

The plots in this dashboard are interactive and display options can be controlled using a mouse. Most plots include a [control menu](https://help.plot.ly/zoom-pan-hover-controls/){target="_blank"} on the top with different options for viewing the data. For example, click the camera icon to download a plot.

#### Data sources

Source data used on this website were obtained from multiple sources for the baywide assessment and from the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. Data can be obtained using functions from the tbeptools R package described below. Graphics and tables provided on the dashboard are made available for exploratory purposes only.

The page source content can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com/tbep-tech/fib-dash){target="_blank"}. Nearly all of the data, tables, and plots were created using functions in the [tbeptools](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools){target="_blank"} R software package. Please see the [vignette](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/articles/fib.html){target="_blank"} for a detailed overview of how you can use these functions on your own to work with the data.

#### How to understand and use the dashboard

Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) provide information on the potential exposure risk from contact recreation or fish/shellfish consumption from surface waters with high fecal loads.  These indicators are imperfect and provide only a general overview of the potential risk.  Presence of FIBs does not necessarily indicate the presence of fecal pathogens, but their presence can be used to prioritize areas for further investigation or remediation. 

The FIBs used in this dashboard are *Enterococcus* cell concentrations for the baywide assessment and a mix of pathogens for the EPCHC data. For the latter, these include fecal coliform for the report card and fecal coliform, *Enterococcus*, and *E. Coli* for the map summaries depending on which map is shown.

#### Report card score categories

The report cards on each page use similar methods for defining overall risk categories for the FIBs.  The scores are applied to individual monitoring stations or as a baywide total and describe the likelihood that the samples in a given year exceed a relevant cell concentration threshold.  The thresholds are 400 CFU / 100 mL of *Enterococcus* for the baywide assessments and 130 CFU / 100 mL of fecal coliform for the EPCHC and Manatee County assessments. The score categories are as follows: 

* <span style="color:#2DC938">__A__</span>: < 10% likelihood that the samples exceed the threshold
* <span style="color:#E9C318">__B__</span>: 10-30% likelihood that the samples exceed the threshold
* <span style="color:#EE7600">__C__</span>: 30-50% likelihood that the samples exceed the threshold
* <span style="color:#CC3231">__D__</span>: 50-75% likelihood that the samples exceed the threshold
* <span style="color:#800080">__E__</span>: > 75% likelihood that the samples exceed the threshold

For the baywide assessments, the score categories are assigned to both individual stations and for each bay segment, whereas scores are only assigned to stations for the EPCHC data.  The stations for the baywide assessments were chosen specifically as downstream endpoints that drain directly into each bay segment, whereas the EPCHC and Manatee County stations are more distributed throughout the watershed.  The bay segment score categories are based on the aggregate of all samples from each station that drain into that segment.

#### Map summaries

The maps on each tab show year or year/month summaries for FIBs.  The annual maps show the same score categories for the report cards described above for each station and bay segment for the baywide assessments and for stations only for the EPCHC and Manatee County data. 

The year/month maps show the sample results for each station for a more detailed view of the data in each year.  The year/month summaries show the concentrations at each station using different threshold categories than the scores described above and separate the data differently depending on the dataset. 

The baywide dataset year/month maps show *Enterococcus* concentrations separately as wet or dry samples based on whether a sample was collected after a significant amount of rain occurred prior to sampling or if dry conditions were observed.  The thresholds below are then applied to both wet/dry samples:

* <span style="color:#2DC938">__Green__</span>: Cell concentrations < 35 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#E9C318">__Yellow__</span>: Cell concentrations 35 - 129 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#EE7600">__Orange__</span>: Cell concentrations 130 - 999 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#CC3231">__Red__</span>: Cell concentrations > 999 CFU / 100 mL

Similar thresholds are applied to station samples for the year/month maps for the EPCHC and Manatee County data.  However, samples are not distinguished as wet/dry and the FIB varies depending on the location of the sample.  *Enterococcus* is used for tidally-influenced locations and *E. coli* is used for freshwater locations.

Tidally-influenced *Enterococcus* thresholds for EPCHC/Manatee County year/month maps: 

* <span style="color:#2DC938">__Green__</span>: Cell concentrations < 35 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#E9C318">__Yellow__</span>: Cell concentrations 35 - 129 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#EE7600">__Orange__</span>: Cell concentrations 130 - 999 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#CC3231">__Red__</span>: Cell concentrations > 999 CFU / 100 mL

Freshwater *E. coli* thresholds for EPCHC/Manatee County year/month maps: 

* <span style="color:#2DC938">__Green__</span>: Cell concentrations < 126 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#E9C318">__Yellow__</span>: Cell concentrations 126 - 409 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#EE7600">__Orange__</span>: Cell concentrations 410 - 999 CFU / 100 mL
* <span style="color:#CC3231">__Red__</span>: Cell concentrations > 999 CFU / 100 mL
