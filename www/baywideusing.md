The report card and maps are based on *Enterococcus* cell concentrations with results for bay segments and individual sampling stations. Please view the __METHODS__ tab on the [__OVERVIEW__](#overview) page for a description of the score categories in the report card and the map summaries. 

The displayed data for all of the graphics on this page can be selected using the year slider and area selections at the top.  The year/month map tab includes an additional month slider.  By default, all areas are shown.  To remove an area, select it from the menu and hit the backspace key.

The __REPORT CARD__ tab shows the overall score category each year for sampled locations in the bay.  The row for the selected year from the slider at the top of the page is outlined in black. By default, the bay segment scores are shown. The bay segment abbreviations are as follows: 

* __OTB__: Old Tampa Bay
* __HB__: Hillsborough Bay
* __MTB__: Middle Tampa Bay
* __BCB__: Boca Ciega Bay
* __LTB__: Lower Tampa Bay
* __MR__: Manatee River

Stations that apply to each bay segment can be shown instead by toggling the switch above the report card.

The report card is also interactive and can be zoomed by clicking the mouse and dragging to an area of interest.  Reset the plot by double-clicking.  An image of the report card can be saved by clicking the camera icon that is shown above the report card when the cursor is over the plot. 

The __MAP BY YEAR__ tab shows a map of the report card grades assigned each bay segment and the individual station grades for the selected year. These are the same values shown in the report card.

Placing the cursor over a bay segment or station will reveal additional information.

The __MAP BY YEAR AND MONTH__ tab shows a map of *Enterococcus* concentration categories for the selected year and month. Samples are identified as occurring during wet (circles) or dry (triangles) conditions. See the __METHODS__ tab on the [__OVERVIEW__](#overview) page for a description of the concentration thresholds.

Placing the cursor over a bay segment or station will reveal additional information.

Finally, clicking on a station on the year/month map will create an interactive popup plot for the complete time series of *Enterococcus* concentrations at that location.  The popup plot can be closed by clicking outside the plot area.
